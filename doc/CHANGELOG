[FIXED] If posts had comment status other than 0 and you turned off the comment system and then updated those posts, they would lose their comment status

[NEW] Admin pages now send you back to exactly where you were when you delete an item (e.g. if you delete a post in search results, you go back to search results rather than just the default post list)

----------------------------

[FIXED] Javascript error when loading the pages page

[CHANGED] Added preview of URL to page tool, shows you what the URL of your page will be with live updating

[REMOVED] Dropped the "Simple titles" preference for pages, it isn't necessary

[NEW] Added title field to pages and default views

[REMOVED] Dumped the layout/page thing and set pages to render using the post layout... the chances of people wanting their static pages to look wholly different than the rest of the site seems silly and it adds to much to the theme

[REMOVED] Got rid of the "Rage" theme from the default package. I don't like it and I don't want all SimpleLog-based weblogs to look like that, since it's a very specific style and I'm not sure it's best anyway (I like it on Maniacal Rage, but that's just me)

[FIXED] When you submitted a bad comment, the title of the site was incorrect


Version 1.5b3
----------------------------

[NEW] Added new "Pages" section to admin, this allows you to create "static" pages (for things like about or contact pages)

[FIXED] Forms had different widths to fields/labels in certain sections

[CHANGED] Unapproved comment icon was too light, it's darker now

[NEW] Added icon to key at the top of the comments page to make it clearer about the whole "click to toggle" approval functionality


Version 1.5b1
----------------------------

[FIXED] Improved preference caching and now sites should load MUCH faster, especially in development mode

[FIXED] Fixed pagination problems in various admin sections [tkt #23]

[CHANGED] Tweaks to design and admin CSS

[CHANGED] Moved login to admin-controlled RHTML files (there was no good reason to having this be part of the front-end) [tkt #24]

[CHANGED] Rearranged admin views into more logical subdirectories (doesn't affect users, but makes my life easier)

[NEW] Added "Clear theme cache" link to prefs header [tkt #25]

[NEW] Added ability to download blacklist rules from a clearinghouse hosted at simplelog.net

[NEW] Added support for Gravatars (http://gravatar.com)

[CHANGED] Fixed older references to sidebar in default themes description

[CHANGED] Updated README to better help PostgreSQL users

[FIXED] Fixed reference to "Body raw" in posts admin section when there's an error message (now just says "Body") [tkt #41]

[NEW] Added archives by month, archives by day, archives list, added them to existing included themes

[NEW] Added helper method called get_posts() which takes an SQL statement and returns posts based on what you ask for, useful for getting posts in views (say, for instance, if you want to have a list of your favorite posts based on a tag)

----------------------------

[FIXED] Fixed permalinks in the metaWeblog.getPost method that were returning only the actual unique permalink for posts when it should have been returning full URLs (thanks to Brad Choate for tip)

Version 1.1.2
----------------------------

[FIXED] Fixed a bug created in 1.1.2 where new posts in the DB would have NULL for extended, when they should have an empty string (not really a bug, but a lot of themes' views rely on != '' instead of NULL values)

[NEW] Added migration to clean up NULLs in the DB


Version 1.1.1
----------------------------

[FIXED] Fixed bug where when text filter set to Convert line breaks, blank extended content would come through as <p></p>

[CHANGED] Updated the simplelog_themer rake to properly copy over the unknown_request handling view file

[FIXED] Searching in the admin section wasn't returning inactive posts

[CHANGED] Widened some text input fields in the admin section

[FIXED] Fixed a bug where you couldn't change the created_at date in posts

[FIXED] In the simplelog_themer rake, the version number was coming through as a pref rather than as the actual config value

[NEW] Existing tag block is now hidden by default when in post form

[NEW] Added a preference to show/hide your existing tags block by default when in post form

[NEW] Added a preference to return you to the post after updating rather than the list

[CHANGED] simplelog_themer now replaces the reference to Mint in the layout with the updated version from 1.1 to better make older themes compatible with that preference change

[FIXED] Fixed a bug where empty preference values might cause nil conversion errors, especially in Windows

[FIXED] Somehow accidentally removed the first field focus that I implemented in beta 2, this is back now

[FIXED] Fixed several bugs with tags relating to special characters, validations on update, blank tags, and tag merging

[NEW] Added migration that sanitizes tags (removes spaces, single- and double-quotes and special characters)

[CHANGED] Changed the Mint Directory preference to Mint Location, so that you could use a subdomain URL for your Mint location if you wanted to

[CHANGED] Updated Default and Rage themes (layouts/post.rhtml) to properly deal with different kinds of Mint Location pref values (you'll need to update your theme's layouts/post.rhtml accordingly if you aren't using one of the built-in themes... it's a simple fix, you can just copy the line from the default theme into yours)

[NEW] Added help item relating to Mint Location preference

[FIXED] In the post form, assigned tags were not being highlighted on load due to the window.onload stack being overwritten by the title field focus

[CHANGED] Updated README

[FIXED] When changing themes in prefs in production mode, the cache is cleared and the theme actually changes

[CHANGED] Removed admin section link visited state, links all look the same now (never should have had a diff state to begin with, really)

[FIXED] Updated the validations for posts to better handle permalink checking with bad post content (bad XHTML)

[FIXED] Fixed a bug where when submitting a post with an error, tags would get mashed together

[NEW] Added default focus to the logical form item in each admin section where applicable (post form => title, tag form => name, author form => name, ping and updates => button)

[NEW] Added a shortcut link to create a new post to the navigation of the admin section (the [+] next to Posts)

[FIXED] Creating an author resulted in an error when trying to call prepend_http, accidentally made this a class method before

[FIXED] Typo in the regex for checking valid Items on Index preference values

[FIXED] Fixed a bug where the active checkbox in posts would always check itself when editing a post

[FIXED] Updated the regex for author email validation to be smarter (didn't allow _ or - in emails before (d'oh!))

[NEW] Added preference to encode entities in body content (off by default)

[FIXED] Updated a few preference labels so that clicking on the help link doesn't check/uncheck the checkbox

[FIXED] Permalinks are now created using the title of the post if you don't have simple titles pref enabled

[NEW] Added copy to the additional help FAQs

[FIXED] Tests are working again (you can run them by running `rake simplelog_setup`, which will run functional and unit tests)

[FIXED] Fixed a bug in the migration that affected Rails 1.0.0 users

[FIXED] Tags with spaces cannot be created in admin (auto-strips slashes) to prevent bugs, also strips quotes

[NEW] Added ability to change word spacer in permalinks (from '_' to other) (see to_permalink method in Post model for details)

[NEW] Added config option to server.rb to specify if you're using MySQL for full-text search additions

[CHANGED] Moved views to template system to make it easier to upgrade in the future--from now on you won't have to worry about new versions overwriting your views, you can just back up your template and then dump it into an upgraded SimpleLog install (obviously, however, this means upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1 will be a pain... sorry... it's worth it)

[CHANGED] Changed search URL and made search able to accept GET requests if POST not sent, and exposed search page so you can easily build your own full search results page

[CHANGED] Moved preferences to database

[CHANGED] Rearranged post editing form to make things even simpler by having certain sections hidden but show-able (this is, after all, SIMPLE-log)

[NEW] Added RubyPants, the Ruby version of SmartyPants (written by Gruber) which can change quotes to curly quotes, three dots to ellipses, et cetera (preference, off by default)

[NEW] Added two new help questions and answers relating to preference settings

[NEW] Added time offset setting which appropriately deals with server time offsets app-wide

[NEW] Added three custom fields, enabled and named via preferences, that can be used in posts for random things you might need to store and use in your views

[NEW] Added preference to change link text for extended entries

[NEW] Added preference to enable simple titles, where the first five words of your post will be used as its title on the site (instead of its actual title), titles will still always be used in search results

[NEW] Added a new default template (old template remains as well, it's called "Rage")

[CHANGED] Renamed submit buttons in admin section to be more logical in some cases ("Update this post" instead of "Edit this post")

[FIXED] Fixed a few labels in admin forms to actually be labels for their form fields instead of, well, not

[FIXED] Tags will now be stripped of special characters

[NEW] Added simplelog_themer rake task which will make a theme from SimpleLog 1.0 files, to be used in upgrade to 1.1
