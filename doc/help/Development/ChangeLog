Made sure to set comment status on save of post, regardless of whether or not commenting is turned on<br/><br/>[FIXED] If posts had comment status other than 0 and you turned off the comment system and then updated those posts, they would lose their comment status<br/><br/>[NEW] Admin pages now send you back to exactly where you were when you delete an item (e.g. if you delete a post in search

Send ping checkbox is now disabled if the post is marked as inactive<br/><br/>[NEW] Author select menu is no longer shown in post section if there is only one author in the system<br/><br/>[NEW] You can now easily have previous and next post links show the titles of the posts rather than just "previous" and "next", see post_helper for details<br/><br/>[NEW] Saving preferences and/or clearing the theme cache also cleans out the sessions table, which people should be doing regularly but probably aren't<br/><br/>[NEW] Added preference to change the archive token site-wide from "past" to "archives" or "older" (default is past), any of these links will work from this point on regardless of the setting<br/><br/><br/>Version 1.5b4<br/>----------------------------<br/><br/>[FIXED] Javascript error when loading the pages page<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Added preview of URL to page tool, shows you what the URL of your page will be with live updating<br/><br/>[REMOVED] Dropped the "Simple titles" preference for pages, it isn't necessary<br/><br/>[NEW] Added title field to pages and default views<br/><br/>[REMOVED] Dumped the layout/page thing and set pages to render using the post layout... the chances of people wanting their static pages to look wholly different than the rest of the site seems silly and it adds to much to the theme<br/><br/>[REMOVED] Got rid of the "Rage" theme from the default package. I don't like it and I don't want all SimpleLog-based weblogs to look like that, since it's a very specific style and I'm not sure it's best anyway (I like it on Maniacal Rage, but that's just me)<br/><br/>[FIXED] When you submitted a bad comment, the title of the site was incorrect<br/><br/><br/>Version 1.5b3<br/>----------------------------<br/><br/>[NEW] Added new "Pages" section to admin, this allows you to create "static" pages (for things like about or contact pages)<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Removed "SimpleLog:" from the admin nav bar, it's getting too crowded (might need to start redesigning soon)<br/><br/><br/>Version 1.5b2<br/>----------------------------<br/><br/>[FIXED] Post content preview would jump in an out sometimes, display extra links occasionally<br/><br/>[FIXED] Post content preview area wasn't already showing when posting a new post with comment preview turned on<br/><br/>[FIXED] Option to allow subjects in comments was in preferences but field wasn't in theme<br/><br/>[FIXED] Navigation in admin broke to two lines in Windows (admin is now 20px wider)<br/><br/>[FIXED] If comment system was turned off, saving/updating comments failed<br/><br/>[FIXED] Prefs nav item wasn't bold when you were in the prefs section<br/><br/>[FIXED] Forms had different widths to fields/labels in certain sections<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Unapproved comment icon was too light, it's darker now<br/><br/>[NEW] Added icon to key at the top of the comments page to make it clearer about the whole "click to toggle" approval functionality<br/><br/><br/>Version 1.5b1<br/>----------------------------<br/><br/>[FIXED] Improved preference caching and now sites should load MUCH faster, especially in development mode<br/><br/>[FIXED] Fixed bug where site would ask for theme many, many times on each load, slowing down rendering<br/><br/>[FIXED] Fixed bug where tags would show up if there were inactive posts assigned to them [tkt #18]<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Changed the build_tag_block and build_author_block methods to allow you to override the default labels of "Tags:" and "Authors:" [tkt #16]<br/><br/>[FIXED] After posting a new post, you now get sent back to it if you have "return to post" pref turned on [tkt #17]<br/><br/>[FIXED] "Show" link when editing post now hidden if the post is currently saved as inactive [tkt #19]<br/><br/>[FIXED] Trying to view a post that was inactive on the front-end would error, now redirects to / [tkt #19]<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Widened the admin section a little to make room for comments nav item<br/><br/>[NEW] Added commenting functionality (new prefs as well, see "Comment Settings" section) [tkt #11]<br/><br/>[NEW] Added an alternate default theme with comment support<br/><br/>[FIXED] Searching in the admin section was inaccurate if your query contained a single quote [tkt #20]<br/><br/>[NEW] New help questions added<br/><br/>[FIXED] Custom fields were coming through as NULL when they weren't turned on, instead of as '' [tkt #21]<br/><br/>[FIXED] Replaced all find_all and find_first and render_partial references in the app with proper finds, to comply with newer Rails standards<br/><br/>[FIXED] Fixed pagination problems in various admin sections [tkt #23]<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Tweaks to design and admin CSS<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Moved login to admin-controlled RHTML files (there was no good reason to having this be part of the front-end) [tkt #24]<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Rearranged admin views into more logical subdirectories (doesn't affect users, but makes my life easier)<br/><br/>[NEW] Added "Clear theme cache" link to prefs header [tkt #25]<br/><br/>[NEW] Added ability to download blacklist rules from a clearinghouse hosted at simplelog.net<br/><br/>[NEW] Added support for Gravatars (http://gravatar.com)<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Fixed older references to sidebar in default themes description<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Updated README to better help PostgreSQL

to specify if you're using MySQL for full-text search additions<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Moved views to template system to make it easier to upgrade in the future--from now on you won't have to worry about new versions overwriting your views, you can just back up your template and then dump it into an upgraded SimpleLog install (obviously, however, this means upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1 will be a pain... sorry... it's worth it)<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Changed search URL and made search able to accept GET requests if POST not sent, and exposed search page so you can easily build your own full search results page<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Moved preferences to database<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Rearranged post editing form to make things even simpler by having certain sections hidden but show-able (this is, after all,

preference to enable simple titles, where the first five words of your post will be used as its title on the site (instead of its actual title), titles will still always be used in search results<br/><br/>[NEW] Added a new default template (old template remains as well, it's called "Rage")<br/><br/>[CHANGED] Renamed submit buttons in admin section to be more logical in some cases ("Update this post" instead of "Edit this post")<br/><br/>[FIXED] Fixed a few labels in admin forms to actually be labels for their form fields instead of, well, not<br/><br/>[FIXED] Tags will now be stripped of special characters<br/><br/>[NEW] Added simplelog_themer rake task which will make a theme from SimpleLog 1.0 files, to be used in upgrade to 1.1<br/><br/><br/>Version
