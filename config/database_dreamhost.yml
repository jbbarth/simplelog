# dreamhost is a little different--they use hosts rather than sockets

development:
  adapter: mysql
  database: simplelog_dev
  username: simplelog
  password: 
  host: sql.yoursite.com

# Warning: The database defined as 'test' will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run 'rake'.
#
# DO NOT SET THIS DB TO THE SAME AS DEVELOPMENT OR PRODUCTION!
test:
  adapter: mysql
  database: simplelog_test
  username: simplelog
  password: 
  host: sql.yoursite.com

# Unless you have a specific reason, leave this the same as 
# development when installing SimpleLog, since this allows for
# easy DB setup using rake (see README for installation
# instructions)
production:
  development
